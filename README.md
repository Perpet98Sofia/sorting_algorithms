Sorting algorithms & Big O
Various sorting algorithms such as selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort.
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on.
At the end of this project, I was able to achieve:

At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
